										<p>Holy shit!! I’m actually pretty embarrassed of what I’m about to write down, but I’m also thrilled to say the least. It's just mixed feelings.  I personally don’t like people knowing about my personal life but recently I've been wanting to change that about myself. Like why the fuck live life and just keep all of your experiences(either good or bad) locked up inside of you? Just make it simple, let people learn from you day in and day out, and let them help you out as well.  And yes, people will hurt you, but that’s life, so we have to stop being such pussies and take the most we can from life.</p>

										<p> I actually wrote this poem once upon a time about a girl that I once “loved". I placed “loved” in quotation marks because every girl I have really liked throughout my young adult life I’ve liked the latter one more than the former one. So maybe I haven’t been in love just yet, possibly I’ve just received this sense of satisfaction, acceptance, and attention from each one of them that has made me believe I've been in love but I haven't.</p><p>  One thing that I’ve learned though is that liking someone is not the same as loving someone as being in love with someone.  You can love the person but not like them. What I mean is that you can be so infatuated with either your significants others attention or the sex is too good that you feel a caressent love towards that person. But there could be a possibility that you guys don't have anything in common or just don't enjoy each others passions, but character is so important. You have to love their character foremost than anything else. That’s why falling in love with your best friend is possibly the best thing you can do.</p><p> But getting back to the point, the reason I wanted to show this  poem I wrote a while back is not because I have feelings for this girl or anything of that sort but because of how brutal it is, which is the way I conceive it to be each time I read it.  Each time I read it I’m saying to myself, "what the fuck? Did I actually think like this?". I wrote this poem couple of months before her and I completely stopped talking. Even though we never officially dated I can truly say that I cared for her and always tried my best to make her happy; however, there was a particular reason that didn't allow us to be together which I won't mention, but if it wasn't for that reason then maybe we would have been together. We had great memories but they're long gone now and I believe it was a great learning lesson. It really showed me how to better value women.   </p>





<p><i><b>"I hope you can read this one day and know that I cared for you dearly.  I love you.  I can’t take it anymore though, it just hurts inside my beloved.  I have to be happy and I’m not.  I know you're happy with me now but I will have to break the news to you soon.  I’m sorry.  I hope you take it lightly.  I’m doing it for me.  My beloved.  My feelings can rot in shit though.  You’ll never be mine.  I’ll never be yours. I have to face the fact that it’s supposed to be that way.  What an anguish my beloved.  I pictured of the day I would wake up to your smile.  Maybe it was the sense of satisfaction I got when I thought about it.  I pictured myself never hurting you.  I will though.  My beloved.  I promised never to leave you.  But I will.  If I could, Ill give you the world,  My beloved.  I promise you one thing though.  A promise you will never hear.  Ill never marry any girl if I don’t love her like I loved you.  But I hope I find someone that I love more than you.  Because I can’t live life knowing that you were the best it ever got.  I know ill find someone better. You’re still my everything.  my princess. My beloved. "</b></i></p>

<p>I decided not to edit this poem but keep its original script even though it might have
	some mistakes because by doing so makes me learn from myself. The ways I've thought even ways my style of writing has changed. That's why we should all write, you see how you change throughout time, either for the better or the worst.</p>

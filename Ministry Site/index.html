							<h2 class="fix">About</h2>
							<p>Our mission is to save as many lives as possible through the Lord <em> Jesus
		   					Christ</em>. We are ministers Angel and Maritza Benitez who have been cristians
		   					since birth.  Our goals are simple; Reach people, save people through<em>Christ</em>, and pray and minister through the church community.  The reason Foundation Church exists is to glorify God. We believe that God is most glorified in us as we learn to trust and be satisfied in Him alone. </p>
						</section>
						<section class="12u$(medium)">
							 <p>   We seek to glorify God by putting our trust in Him, following in His ways, and gathering together as many new worshipers of him as possible.  We want to treasure Him in corporate and in private worship, know Him better by learning the Bible and communcating with Him in prayer.  We also want to extend His love to others in the greater community through fellowship, support, discipleship and service.  We rely on God Himsleft to bring change, growth, healing and maturity to our church</p>

							<h3>Beliefs</h3>
							   <p>God is sovereign over all things such that there is no aspect of reality outside of His ultimate control. Though God's rule extends to all things, it is particularl His soveregnty over the work of salvation that is a theological distincitve.  We believe that it is exceedingly good and glorious news that salvation is not depedent on the desires and deeds of man, but is grounded intead in God's eternal decree of election. Though man is responsible for his sin, God is ultimately and entirely responsible for drawing those He would save unto Himself and overcoming their natural resistance to the gospel.
	   							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="12u$(medium)">
							<h3>The Gifts of the Holy Spirit</h3>
							<p>The gifts of the Holy Spirit that we see exercised in the Scriptures have not ceased with the death of the last Apostle or the closing of the New Testament canon. They are available today and are to be eagerly desired and practiced in submission to the SPirit speaking though the Scripture</p>
						</div>
						<!-- Break -->
						<div class="12u$(medium)">
							<h3>Men and Women</h3>
							 <p>Men and women are absolutely equal in essence, dignity and valu but are different by divine design.  As part of God's good created order, men and women are to have different yet complementary roles and responsibilities in the home and church, especially as it comes to teaching and authority. These role distincitos are God's grace to man and woman and are to be protected, preserved and practiced for His glory and our joy</p>
						</div>
						<div class="12u$(medium)">
							<h3>Mission and Missionaries</h3>
	   						<p>We believe that the mission of the church is to reveal the good news of Jesus to a lost world.  Theis is done through loving one another within the church, loving those outside of the church and through the verbal proclamation of the gospel.</p>
						</div>
						<div class=" 12u$(medium)">
							<h3>Worship</h3>
	   						<p>Worship is at the very heart of the church's life.  All that the church is and does is rooted in its worship of God.  The community of faith, gathered in response to God's call, is formed in its worship.  Worship is the principal influence that shapes our faith, and is the most visible way we express our faith.</p>
						</div>
							<div class=" 12u$(medium)">
							 <h3>Giving</h3>
	  						 <p>As Christians, giving of your time, talent and treasure is part of our worship. Resources for online giving are coming soon.  In the meantime, if you would like to give financially or by serving, then please <a href="#Contact">visit</a> or <a href="#Contact">contact</a> us for assistance</p>

									<h2>The beginning...</h2>
									<!--<p>Aliquam commodo sed magna</p>-->
								</header><!-- Modal -->
								<p>When I first met Jason. It was nothing special. It wasn't love at first sight. Afterall, we were sitting in a booth at Denny's when I first met him, surely this would not be the man I'd marry. He was just a friend of a friend's, and we all just happened to be at the same place at the same time...
<!--Except, that wasn't the last I'd seen of Jason. Being the sneakerhead he is, he frequents a lot of shoe stores, and, of course, I worked at Champs at the time, so our paths continued to cross every once in a while. We'd chat, say hi, but that was it. There was no love at second sight or third sight either. By 2010, I'd decided to make the first move, but I assure you, I wasn't interested in anything other than a friendship. I wanted to reconnect with my faith, so I asked Jason to attend a church service with me that neither of us had ever been to before. The service came and went, but we weren't ready to end the day together. We ate at Olive Garden, even though Jason hadn't told me then that he despises the place. We went back to my apartment, watched TV, still not ready to part ways. Then, we went to the theatre that night, saw a movie that neither one of us can recall to this day, and the twelve hours together with Jason only felt like a couple.
Okay, so at this point it's possible that Jason wasn't just a friend in my mind, but things progressed slowly, and that was okay. His personality was breathtaking, as was our first, long awaited kiss on New Year's Eve. It was obvious we enjoyed each other's company, but things did not become serious until Jason began regularly attending my church in 2012. We were not very inconspicuous; people noticed the love that followed each of our movements. "Who is this boy that keeps following you around and why isn't he your boyfriend?" people would ask. My patience lasted longer than our spectators, but enough was enough, and through a bland text message, Jason and I became an official couple on April 19th, 2013.
I am a girl of romance, so naturally Jason had a bit of making up to do. So let me skip to the good stuff—the PROPOSAL. And, to be clear, Jason is a romantic, so I was not worried about the surprise he had for our "two-year anniversary."
The morning of April 18th, Jason took me to Denny's for breakfast. Not typically a romantic destination, but this was the place we first met. I thought we'd spend all day together, but he dropped me off at the nail salon, insisting that I'd get a mani/pedi and relax. Meanwhile, he wasn't relaxing; he was laying out my entire outfit for the evening that he picked out himself, a surprise for when I'd return home. Surprised I was! I couldn't believe I could call this man mine. The surprises just kept strolling in. Then, Jason took me to Olive Garden, where we had our first "date", and it hit me. Jason was reliving every important moment in our relationship, so I was not so surprised when the next stop was The Melting Pot, where he had first said the words, "I love you." The restaurant wasn't even open yet, but Jason, of course, had planned out everything the day before. They were expecting us. We were the only ones in the restaurant, sharing dessert at a small table, but I barely noticed the emptiness of the place—it was just about the two of us.
By the time we arrived at Harbor House, I figured we were in the midst of creating a new memory because nothing special had happened here. However, when the host informed us of the twenty minute wait, I was less than impressed. Most of the tables were open, how could there be a wait? Jason suggested a walk to pass the time, but my Puerto Rican blood was beginning to boil. I didn't want a walk, I wanted prompt service. Jason must have been a bit nervous; I was on the brink of ruining his plan. Finally, Jason convinced me that a walk was a good idea.
Through the gusts of wind, I held Jason's hand tightly as we veered toward the art museum. I knew I loved this man, and I was wrapped up in such thoughts of awe that I barely noticed the guy playing a guitar as we neared the peak of the museum. When I spotted the videographer near the guitar-playing man, I looked at Jason, asking him if these people were here for us. With a smile, all he said was "yes." Jason continued talking, compliments spilled out of his lips, a speech was ensuing of the love he held for me. Jason had quite out done himself for our two-year anniversary—it was the only thought in my head, but this was quickly interrupted as he announced, "Daena, this is it."
He was on his knees, I was screaming "OH MY GOD", he was asking me to marry him, and I was crying. Barely composed, I said "yes!", and he stood up, pointing toward the windows of the art museum. My eyes drunk with love, I followed his finger to where he was pointing. The windows were the not regular art museum windows, filled with the casual art enthusiast here and there. No, the windows were filled with both our families, waving their congratulations our way. It had been much longer than twenty minutes, but we all returned to the Harbor House to enjoy dinner with our new family.
But the surprises were not over (I know, what else could Jason possibly surprise me with?). At dinner, Jason stood to make an announcement. He wanted to have the wedding in October—if it was okay with me. Certainly, it was. Just six months to plan a wedding, but I could not wait to marry the love of my life!
And now Jason and I are ready. The planning has been done and the party can start. We cannot wait to share our love with you on October 1st, 2015.

										<p><em><b>Ramses I</b>, Seti I, Ramses II, Merneptah, Seti II, Siptah, Twosret<em>. It's not about the glory, the fame, the monuments, or statues.  It's all about the power.</p>
<p>
What a great saturated feeling it must be to rule the world.  This isn’t about him,her, or them but about me.
  The center of the one and only.  The Kings of Egypt aren’t scattered or futile, we're only reciprocating by our manifestation of power, which makes us King.  Who can doubt us? who will? 
 <em>Ramses I, Seti I, Ramses II, Merneptah, Seti II, Siptah, Twosret,</em> oh the Kings of Egypt.</p>
<p>
Many say the delusional, the conceded, the narcissist. We say, the hungry but they're pessimist, the sayers but they’re followers.  They're weak for they stand where they lay because of their cultured hypocrisy.</p>
<p>
From Egypt to Rome to the West, many have concurred the world. And we the Kings of Egypt live no more, but of such dynasty, the 19th dynasty, we have begotten a new life for the rest of eternity.<em> Ramses I, Seti I, Ramses II, Merneptah, Seti II, Siptah, Twosret</em>, oh the Kings of Egypt. </p>

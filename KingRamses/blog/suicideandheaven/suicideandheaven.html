Though it might not be in my best interest to assert this question,  I felt the necessity to do so because of how incorrect this belief has been maneuvered by evangelicals and even non-christians.  Actually, questions like, can people live in sin all their life, repent at their death bed then go to heaven plausible? Many evangelicals believe that a sinner can proclaim(i.e. repent) to the Lord on his/hers last breath and be saved.  But a believer who lives a godly life but dies in sin(e.g. suicide) doesn’t have the same fate? Double standards don't you think? Is it plausible to commit suicide as a christian and still go to heaven? I will try to conclude this statement as true by answering four questions.<i><br/>[For the purpose of vagueness I will define what a christian is; If you give your life to the Lord and believe that Jesus is the Son of God who came to fulfill the law and save us from all our past, present, and future sins then you are a christian. In which thereafter a christian goes to heaven after death.]</i></p>


<h2>What is suicide?</h2>

<p>Suicide is the action of killing oneself intentionally, and it is prohibited by the command, “You shall not murder." Exodus 20:13. It is a great sin against the high God and results in devastation not only to you but to other loved ones as well.  Suicide is a merely physical act that the type of people who commit the act do so to escape the life they're currently living.</p>

<h2>How can a christian do such a thing?</h2>
 <p>We now have to figure out if it's possible for christians to commit such an act. Can a chrisitian love the Lord and end up in such despair? Well time and time again we see in the bible all sorts of God’s people in despair who proclaim upon God to kill them. There are three biblical characters whom I want to briefly talk about, who through despair wanted life to end:</p>

<h6>Moses</h6><p>
Moses said to the Lord, "Why have you dealt ill with your servant? And why have I not found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me? Did I conceive all this people? Did I give them birth, that you should say to me, ‘Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries a nursing child,’ to the land that you swore to give their fathers? Where am I to get meat to give to all this people? For they weep before me and say, ‘Give us meat, that we may eat.’  I am not able to carry all this people alone; the burden is too heavy for me.  If you will treat me like this, kill me at once, if I find favor in your sight, that I may not see my wretchedness." Numbers 11:11-15</p>

<h6>Elijah</h6><p>
A great man of God who through stretching himself on the body of a widows son restored his life, yet his life eventually came to such despair and guilt that he pleaded with God to kill him.</p>

<h6>Jeremiah</h6><p>
A priest who God called to be His prophet also failed in the traphole of anguish.
"My joy is gone; grief is upon me; my heart is sick within me." Jeremiah 8:18</p>

<p>
These are people chosen by God to perform his will and at one point or another were living in misery.  They couldn’t deal with the burden life had brought them. Listen to this scripture, "For we do not want you to be unaware, brothers, of the affliction we experienced in Asia. For we were so utterly burdened beyond our strength that we despaired of life itself. Indeed, we felt that we had received the sentence of death. " 2 Corinthians 1: 8-9.</p>


<p><h2>Is this sin unforgivable?</h2>
Though this is within its own subject matter and it's explained in many different ways by theologians studying this passage's exegesis, it is clear that the answer lies in Mark 3:22-30 and Matthew 12:22-32. The only unforgivable sin is "Blasphemy of the Holy Spirit". This is when you defile God, you accuse the creator, and/or not part of him. So if christians can despair life, and suicide is forgivable then we just need a final piece to the puzzle.</p>


<h2>Can a sinful act separate us from the Lord?</h2>


<blockquote><i>"There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death" </i>Romans 8:1-2</blockquote>


 <blockquote><i>"But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness" </i>Rom 8:10</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will certainly not cast out."</i> John 6:37</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"… and all He has given Me I lose nothing, but raise it up on the last day."</i> John 6:39</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ - by grace you have been saved - and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus"</i> Ephesians 2:4-6</blockquote>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<h4>I.</h4><p>If Jesus can forgive all your past, present, and future sins, and suicide is a forgivable sin, then suicide is forgivable.  If christians aren’t able to be separated from the Lord, no matter the act of sin, then suicide will not separate us from the Lord.</p>

<h4>II.</h4><p>
Therefore if a christian commits suicide, then this person is forgiven, not separated from the Lord, and still a christian. So from our definition from above, all christians go to heaven. </p>  

<h4>III.</h4><p>
	Hence a christian can commit suicide and go to heaven.</p>

<p>
Though this is a very hard subject matter to study and understand I can conclude that whomever tries to harm themselves or commits suicide, has committed a terrible, stupid, sinful act, but through God’s grace and forgiveness are forgiven in their trespasses.</p>
